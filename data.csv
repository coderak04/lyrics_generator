love the run but not the race all alone in a silent way world drifts in and the world s a stranger in a light eclipsed and alienated in a time occupied and invaded can t tell what s right better hit the ground running in the hills where the tall weed grows hands are tied and won t let go can t escape this place without leaving the world behind in a light ashamed and humiliated in a time sacrificed for the sake of trade the soul is bent feels the weight of truth falling through left behind no choice but to run to the mountains where no poppies grow you have to hit the ground running in a light paralyzed and spirits fading out of time must decide to fall or run into the eye of the storm no sign or omen make it right or fall to the other side where fields are burning from the day you re born you ll always hit the ground running
was i asleep did you save me from disaster wake up and tell me i m just imagining thought i would brave it cause i don t wanna live in doubt dreamt of escape but i m nowhere near the feeling fell from a high but i never hit the ground can t hold the weight of your words heavy on my mind so i m gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run keep it away from my soul i m not holding it all i m gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run all that we know will get old and with you i ll unfold i m gonna lay my head down open your hand i know your heart line s the deepest you will replace it a new love you will find say all you like but i ll make it better on my own so i m gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run keep it away from my soul i m not holding it all i m gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run all that we know will get old and with you i ll unfold i m gonna lay my head down so i m gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run keep it away from my soul i m not holding it all i m gonna lay my head down on your shoulder and run all that we know will get old and with you i ll unfold i m gonna lay my head down2

i met you through a common friend in the attic of my parents house and though i didn t know it then i soon was finding out you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet and hold the earth in place each time a faucet opens words are spoken the water runs away and i hear your name no nothing has changed there was this book i read and loved the story of a ship who sailed around the world and found that nothing else exists beyond his own two sails and wooden shell and what is held within all else is sure to pass we clutch and grasp and debate what s truly permanent but when the wind starts to shift well there s no argument now i sing and drink and sleep on floors and try hard not to be annoyed by all these people worrying about me so when i m suffering through some awful drive you occasionally cross my mind it s my hidden hope that you are still among them well are you oh you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet and hold the earth in place each time a curtain opens sunlight pours in a lifetime melts away and we share a name on some picturesque grave

as we all go through life we immediately learn things don t always go as we please decisions get harder and the time of our lives withers through our grasp but no matter how calloused and hardened we get to all of life s imperfections the sense of hopelessness still cuts the most the thought of being without a purpose never really goes away and never stings any less through broken homes destructive relationships and life changing events with false securities and double standards it can be difficult to make sense of it all we understand and we will never give up believing in you to tell you a million times over the vitality of your true worth the sacrifice of pure love and grace intended for you and i a sacrifice that will always remind us no matter how hopeless you may feel you are never alone and in the end it will all matter we are all here side by side we will endure and we will provide therefore do not lose heart for on the outside we may waste away but on the inside we are renewed day by day hope never falters and never disappoints and i have faith that neither will you

faded photograph covered now with lines and creases tickets torn in half memories in bits and pieces traces of love long ago that didn t work out right traces of love ribbons from her hair souvenirs of days together the ring she used to wear pages from an old love letter traces of love long ago that didn t work out right traces of love with me tonight i close my eyes and say a prayer that in her heart she ll find a trace of love still there somewhere oh oh traces of hope in the night that she ll come back and dry these traces of tears from my eyes
and as they say grief is only able to possess the rotting body clad in ancient clothes is left behind with a wave of the hand i have gone away the bed is cold and empty trees bend their boughs toward the earth and nighttime birds float as black faces it was the hand reaching out through the mirror unknown and scarred by life the luring eyes you had never seen you have nothing more to find you have nothing more to lose you have nothing more to find you have nothing more to lose the cold season drifts over the land they huddle in the brown corners some would settle for less the castles were all empty asleep long awaiting their king beckoning round the bend amidst the forest one would hear that i had been there draped within a fate i could not change and always welcoming winter s epilogue
remember that night i had to leave you you said it s alright and i believed you you know i m no good no good at goodbyes no good without you better by your side wish i could be there with you i m feeling lost without you in this empty bed where i m all alone i ve been such a mess need a one way ticket anywhere you are is where i want to go you are my address i don t care how i get it i need a one way ticket home need a one way ticket home  when you re not with me these days are boring wish it were easy like sunday morning when i d be waking up with you only doing those things we wanna do my heart is anywhere you go when i m next to you i m home wish i could be there with you i m feeling lost without you in this empty bed where i m all alone i ve been such a mess need a one way ticket anywhere you are is where i want to go you are my address i don t care how i get it i need a one way ticket home need a one way ticket home i need a one way ticket home in this empty bed where i m all alone i ve been such a mess in this empty bed where i m all alone i ve been such a mess need a one way ticket anywhere you are is where i want to go you are my address i don t care how i get it i need a one way ticket home one way ticket home i need a one way ticket home i don t care how i get it i need a one way ticket home1
childhood remembrances are always a drag if youre black you always remember things like living in woodlawn with no inside toilet and if you become famous or something they never talk about how happy you were to have your mother all to yourself and how good the water felt when you got your bath from one of those big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in and somehow when you talk about home it never gets across how much you understood their feelings as the whole family attended meetings about hollydale and even though you remember your biographers never understand your fathers pain as he sells his stock and another dream goes and though youre poor it isnt poverty that concerns you and though they fought a lot it isnt your fathers drinking that makes any difference but only that everybody is together and you and your sister have happy birthdays and very good christmases and i really hope no white person ever has cause to write about me because they never understand black love is black wealth and theyll probably talk about my hard childhood and never understand that all the while i was quite happy8
lady lovely as light you lie beside me while i dream but at dawn you disappear who decides how much longing is the right amount so many times i nearly found you i lost count each time i think i m close enough to touch you you hide from me seductively just like the moon behind a cloud in the voice of the rain i hear you call me in the sky of your eyes i fly and fall who decides how much longing is the right amount so many times i nearly found you i lost count each time i think i m close enough to touch you you hide from me seductively just like the moon behind a cloud
in the middle of a moment in the dark of a dream with the focus of a fool man you can tell me anything there s a reason for deceit and the chaos that i covet try to find my self before i start to loathe it no i can t just let you run i never knew such sorrow as the setting sun now i take my last breath of my lonesome only friend oh give me what i please the desire to be free just to stop all the pain and the shivering no i can t seem to let it go the truth it leaks like a lie i know you tried to save me baby but you ran out of time no i can t see myself astray i feel the emptiness at the first light of day and now i take my last breath oh my lonesome only friend i try to run but i can only crawl every time i stand i slip and surely fall oh now i take my last breath of my lonesome only friend

hello darkness my old friend i ve come to talk with you again because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while i was sleeping and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence in restless dreams i walked alone narrow streets of cobblestone neath the halo of a street lamp i turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never share and no one dared disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence 2

sensed but unheard as the curtain softly stirs it is not just a memory but it lives and breathes watching over you whilst you sleep kneeling beside you when you weep hey don t be afraid don t try to run away because pain can be your friend as it explains the answers to your questions consoles you in blue reflections listens to your soul s confessions then leads you in new directions so open your heart again and feel the walls dissolve something s whispering to you it s time to let go because the only thing that stays the same is that everything must change everything must change hey embrace your pain you cannot run away and pain can be your friend as it explains the answers to your questions consoles you in blue reflections listens to your soul s confessions then leads you in new directions and all the while that you were waiting for love to keep the light from waning it s pain that stops the heart from hating that cures the mind of hesitating that helps the soul in separating from everything that it s been blaming everything s changing
